# ü§ñ AI-Powered Adverse Event Detection from PubMed Literature

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be applied in Pharmacovigilance (PV) to extract adverse events (AEs) from biomedical literature.

---

## üìå Objective

To build a pipeline that:
- Fetches abstracts from PubMed based on a drug + AE query
- Preprocesses and tokenizes the abstracts using NLP
- Detects potential adverse events using a predefined AE list
- Visualizes the frequency of detected AEs

---

## üîß Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- BioPython (Entrez API)
- spaCy (NLP)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)
- Pandas (DataFrame management)

---

## üìö Dataset Source

Abstracts are fetched dynamically using PubMed Entrez API.  
Search term used: `"paracetamol adverse events"`

---

## üöÄ Workflow

1. **Phase 1‚Äì2**: Environment setup and PubMed abstract fetching
2. **Phase 3**: NLP-based text preprocessing
3. **Phase 4**: AE keyword matching and detection
4. **Phase 5**: AE frequency visualization

## üìä Sample Output

| Abstract_Index | AE_Detected               |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1              | ["nausea", "liver damage"] |
| 2              | ["dizziness", "rash"]     |
